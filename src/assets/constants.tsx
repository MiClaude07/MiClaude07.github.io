export const biop1 = `Hello! My name is Michael Claude and I am currently a Third Year at the University of Massachuetts Boston. I am majoring in Computer Science with a Minor in English. I am an alumni of the Hack Diversity Fellowship. I interened at AWS for the Summer of 2023 and will be returning as an intern for the Summer of 2024.

It's hard to say what field I specefically want to go in. I enjoy learning all different kinds of Computer Science topics and value my experience with all of them. 

Outside of Computer Science, I enjoy reading and writing stories. I like to share ideas and works with other writers in order to further my growth as both a writer and reader.`;
